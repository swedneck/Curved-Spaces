#	Binary Dihedral Group D₈*
#
#	The quotient of the 3-sphere by the binary dihedral group D₈*
#	(of order 32) gives a prism space based on an hexadecagonal prism.
#	The matrix elements lie in the field Q[???] (NEED TO THINK ABOUT THIS!).

#THESE NUMERICAL VALUES WERE COMPUTED WITH STANDARD DOUBLE-PRECISION FLOATING POINT ARITHEMETIC,
#AND COULD BE WRONG IN THEIR LAST BINARY BIT OR TWO.
